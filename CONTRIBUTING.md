# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to this repository!
This repository holds the locale files for lb-phone script. To maintain consistency and quality, please adhere to the following guidelines.

---

## General Guidelines

1. **Follow the `en.json` Structure**  
    All locale files must follow the structure defined in the [`en.json`](https://github.com/lbphone/lb-phone-locales/blob/main/en.json) file. This ensures uniformity across translations.

    - Keys and their hierarchy should match exactly.

2. **Indentation**  
    Use **4 spaces** for indentation in all JSON files.

3. **One File per Commit**  
    Each commit should only include changes to a single locale file. This makes it easier to review and track changes.

    - If you are updating multiple locale files, separate the changes into distinct commits.
